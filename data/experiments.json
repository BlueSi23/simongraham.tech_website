Calculating pixel densities, generating test patterns, and verifying signal flows usually requires switching between multiple single-purpose apps.\n\n### The Solution\n**OpKit Patchbay** is a \"visual patchbay\" for the web. Built on **React Flow**, it allows users to chain together functional nodes—Generators, Analyzers, and Calibration tools—into custom workflows."
