- **Design & Aesthetic**
  - Dark, type-forward layouts inspired by the reference PNG with subtle dividing lines and restrained motion.
  - Prefer generous negative space, tight tracking for small labels, and minimal color beyond grayscale accents.

- **Implementation Preferences**
  - Use server components for data-fetching pages; keep client components small and intentionally scoped (forms, embeds).
  - Centralise Firestore access in `lib/firestore.ts` and avoid ad-hoc calls inside components.
  - Keep layout primitives (`Header`, `Footer`, `Container`) stable; compose sections on pages rather than nesting complex logic in the layout.

- **Content & Data**
  - Ensure MDX filenames and Firestore `slug` fields stay in sync for experiments/articles.
  - Use front matter primarily for content-facing metadata; keep query-critical fields (slug, tags, featured, dates) in Firestore.

- **Docs & Memory Bank**
  - Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` after significant structural changes.
  - When adding new patterns, capture them in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to keep future work aligned.
