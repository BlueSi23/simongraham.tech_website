Calculating pixel densities, generating test patterns, and verifying signal flows usually required switching between multiple single-purpose apps, copying and pasting assets and values between each one.\n\n// My Solution\n'OpKit Patchbay' is a node based workflow toolkit for the web. Built on 'React Flow', it allows users to chain together functional nodes; Generators, Analysers, and Calibration tools into custom saveable and sharable workflows."
