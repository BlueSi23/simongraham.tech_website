excerpt: Why complex experiential projects fall apart at the seams, and how a creative technologist can help teams see the whole system at once.

Most failures in experiential work don’t happen because a single person made a bad decision.

They happen in the seams—between agencies and fabricators, software and hardware, “the deck” and the actual venue. Each team optimises for their piece, often with incomplete information about everyone else’s constraints.

When I’m brought into a project, my first job is to **map the system**:

- Who is actually making decisions, and on what cadence?
- Where do changes get recorded—and who never sees those documents?
- Which parts of the stack are hard to change, and which are surprisingly flexible?

Once you can see the system, it becomes easier to make pragmatic calls:

- Which risks are genuinely existential, and which are just loud?
- What should be prototyped immediately versus left for later?
- Where will a simple coordination ritual do more than a new tool?

This isn’t glamorous work, but it’s often the difference between *“that was a heroic save”* and *“that was surprisingly straightforward.”* The goal is to make the next ambitious thing less of an exception and more of a repeatable pattern.
